        I have decided to keep developing mathgames66 in github pages and stop developing in google sites. <br>
        This will take a lot of work and as for the Jan 29-30 Weekend I will try to add all github.io games from the old mathgames66 sites on github.io while adding other games as well while creating the new site with real code. <br><br>
        Here are some things I will add to the new mathgames66 website soon after the weekend: <br>
        - Archive all news posts here <br>
        - Archive all other working self-hostable games here <br>
        - Add the Forum (and maybe chatroom) back <br>
        - improve css (a lot) <br><br>
        But why did mathgames66 have to move? <br>
        - Better SEO (as for the old mathgames66 site you couldnt even find it from searching it up, and recieving a total of 3531 total site views purely from word of mouth is amazing)<br>
        - More flexibility with styling (as 2016 google sites still has a LOT of restrictions, even more than old google sites) <br>
        - MUCH more fluid editor (VSCode) that doesnt brick my pc after I hit more than 100 games (I was at 98!) <br><br>
        The old mg66db/mg66db.github.io repository has been moved to mathgames66/mahtgames66.github.io along with the site itself. <br><br>
        Endless thanks to henrylang from TotallyScience for your advice!
