## Game can't run and the device youre using mathgames66 is on an ipad?

Close all uneccessary tabs and apps, hard reset the ipad (hold the power button) and drag the slider when your ipad says **slide to power off**

**Still doesnt work?** Update your iPad to the latest software update. Don't know how? Go to Settings > General, then tap Software Update.
If you see two software update options available, such as update to iOS XX.X and upgrade to iOS XX, choose the latest version.
